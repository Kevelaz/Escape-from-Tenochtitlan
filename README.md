# Escape-from-Tenochtitlan
# Description
Escape from Tenochtitlan is narrative choice based game. You are a prisoner of war who managed to escape captivity. Now based on your choices you must navigate through the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan to gain your freedom. You must avoid capture and even death. 
I choice this game as way to share and express the culture I come from and to challenge myself with building a narrative story.
